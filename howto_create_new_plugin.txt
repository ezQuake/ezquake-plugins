Basic infrastructure for plugins is in plugin.c, plugin.h and qvm_api.c. You should not need to change these files.
The plugin.def is a list of functions to be exported in the plugin's library.

To create a plugin, create a copy of the dummyplugin plugin. All you then need to edit is the dummyplugin.c.

Start in the int Plug_Init(int *args) function, which is the only mandatory function you need to have in your plugin.
Here first of all the Plug_InitHooks is called, which is only a sequence of Plug_Export calls.

Hook or hooking means that your plugin tells the main program to call given plugin's function when an event occurs.

So far available hooks are:
Tick ExecuteCommand ConExecuteCommand MenuEvent UpdateVideo SbarBase SbarSupplement SbarOverlay ConnectionlessClientPacket ServerMessageEvent ChatMessageEvent CenterPrintMessage SpellCheckMaskedText

If you need another type of hook, you need to code it into the client code first.

After registering of hooks some typical initialization of the plugin starts, like registering own Quake variables and commands.
